title: "TrueBlocks Exploration of GitCoin Data"
output: html_notebook

We used TrueBlocks to extract as much publically available information from
the GitCoin ecosystem as we could in an effort to explore just how open
open shared ledgers are. All data was aquired either from the GitCoin
public APIs or the from on-chain data.

This is a growing document. Please add to it via GitHub Pull Requests

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
l <- c(1,2,3)
plot(l)
