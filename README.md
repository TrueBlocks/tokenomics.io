# Tokenomics.io

A website and research platform associated with TrueBlocks. We're trying to show people what's possible when the world finally has globally accessible permissionless data. We no longer have to "ask permission" to the see the books of our charitable organizations.

"Isn't this a privacy invasion?"

No. It's an experiment trying to figure out what types of organizations can exist in a world where anyone can "look into the books." This is a natural thing that happens with permissionless blockchains.

## Current Experiments

- [Ecosystem-Wide Accounting]
  - [GitCoin](./gitcoin)
  - [Giveth](./giveth)
  - [CLRFund](./clrfund)

- [R Scripts Investigating Other Things](https://github.com/TrueBlocks/tokenomics)
