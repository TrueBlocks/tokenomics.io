Chart ideas
===============
- Histogram of Contrib Amount  
- Scatter Contrib vs. Sybil score  
- Unclaimed from Round 8  
- Scatter plot of sybil score vs. time  
- Time vs. amount per sender (a lot of sends in not a person)  
- Heat maps are interesting  
- Distribution is important
- Mean is appearantly important
- Category (by function) comparison for smart contracts

- latest data https://github.com/gitcoinco/gitcoin_cadcad_model/blob/main/data/2020-03-18/2021-03-18-round9-contributions.csv.xz

- From the Payout Contract there were:

- 1	Finalized calls
- 364	PayoutAdded calls
- 1	Transfer In
- 1	Funded calls
- 167 Transfer Outs
- 167	PayoutClaimed calls

- Function calls per contract

- Calculated estimate after each donation vs. actual

- Auditing

- Add up all donations from grant files and see if it adds to the total in the contract files

- Add the pre-round 4 contracts

- We did reconcilations of the PayoutAdded / PayoutClaimed and compared that against the smart contract. We could have called that a reconcilation and allow the user to download.
