## Gitcoin Data Pouch - Data/Zips

The `./zips` folder holds combinations of the other data sets.

For each address, we include a .gz file of each data set (`apps`, `txs`, `bals`, `logs`, and `neighbors`) for that address in a file called `<address>.tar.gz`.

We also collect together each different data type for all the addresses in a single file called `apps.tar.gz`, `txs.tar.gz`, `logs.tar.gz` or `neighbors.tar.gz`. These can be downloaded from the **Data for Nerds** page.
