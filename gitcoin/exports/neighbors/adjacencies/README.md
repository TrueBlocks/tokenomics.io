## Gitcoin Data Pouch - Data/Neighbors/Adjacencies

A folder containing adjacency lists produced from [../network/neighbor_networds.py](../network/neighbor_networds.py).

The data is arranged with a given address on a new line followed by all linked address to that address on the same line.

### Notes

This data is alpha status and may be (and probably is) incomplete.

### How this Data is Created

1. Generate the neighbors files as explained [here](../README.md)
2. Run the neighbors_network.py file [here](../networks/README.md)
3. The files in this folder are created as part of running that Python script

### Where's the Data?

The actual data produced for this project is too big to put on GitHub. You may download the entire dataset (or any portion) from the [Downloads Tab](https://tokenomics.io/gitcoin) of the website.
