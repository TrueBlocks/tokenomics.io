## Gitcoin Data Pouch - Data/Combined

The combined data folder combines, for each address, each of the data files for that address into a single file. It also collects together for all address each individual data type.

### How this Data is Created

The files in this folder are created at the end of each scan across all of the addresses. A bash shell script called [combine_update.sh](../combine_update.sh).

### Where's the Data?

The actual data produced for this project is too big to put on GitHub. You may download the entire dataset (or any portion) from the [Downloads Tab](https://tokenomics.io/gitcoin) of the website.
