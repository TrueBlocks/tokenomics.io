# Data Pouch

This project is an attempt to demonstrate what World-Wide, Global, Permissionless data as one finds on a blockchain means. We've used
the TrueBlocks tools set to collect and collate information on all of the GitCoin grants. We did this without asking anyone for
any API keys to web servers, without any documentation, without anything other than a locally-running node (Erigon) and locally-running
tools (TrueBlocks). The code that produced this website runs on our Desktop Mac computers in our offices.

Blockchain data cannot be both Big Data and Decentralized. Every person on earth needs to be able to get access to it without asking
any other person on earth permission.
